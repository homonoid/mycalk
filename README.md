### Why?
I am really interested in programming languages, and I've used *parser generators*
a lot. However, I didn't ever make a handwritten parser! So I did right now. 
I think this thing is a good point to start at.

### P.S.

Nim is a surprisingly good language, by the way! It's *clean* to write in.
